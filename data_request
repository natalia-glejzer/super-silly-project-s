# request for data for master thesis

I will need historical price data for currencies, commodities and cryptocurrencies.
  
Every dataset need to have information about Open price, Close price, Lowest price, Highest price, Volumne

Time range: at least one year (for minute intervals), at least 10 years (for daily intervals)

Time interval: preferable daily time intervals but additional data with minute interals would be a plus



Currencies: preferable at least THREE (e.g. USD/EUR, USD/CHF, PLN/EUR).

Commodities: preferable at least two (e.g. OIL, WHEAT, GOLD)

Cryptocurrencies: preferable at least two (e.g. BT, ETH)
