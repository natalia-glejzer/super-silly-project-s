A repository that is supposed to help us
  - develop our fun IT projects;
  - learn how to use git and github.

Feel free to edit the README.md file if you feel like it. Don't be afraid to be silly. 

## How to use github?
Quite long tutorial, but rather informative:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk.
I strongly advise downloading GitHub Desktop (a lot easier to work locally with the code and no need to fool around with the authetication methods).

Here are some commands that I wrote down after watching the tutorial:
  - git status           –> shows all of the files that were updated 

  - git add .             -> while working locally indicate which file you want to track (in this case every signle one of the files) 
  
  - git add nazwa_pliku.file_extension -> adding a specific file to track
  
  - git commit –m “Title of our commit” -m “Longer descriprion (why the changes were made etc.)”       -> sending the changes but they aren’t live yet 
  
  - git push orgin master      --> pushing changes to remote repository, push changes live, origin – location of our git repository, master – branch
