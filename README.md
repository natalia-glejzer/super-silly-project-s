## (づ ◕‿◕ )づ
A repository that is supposed to help us
  - develop our fun IT projects;
  - learn how to use git and github.

Feel free to edit the README.md file if you feel like it. Don't be afraid to be silly. 

## How to use github?
Quite long tutorial, but rather informative:

I strongly advise downloading GitHub Desktop (a lot easier to work locally with the code and no need to fool around with the authetication methods).
